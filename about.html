<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Im a average guy. I was super active and social as a child but when most of my friends moved away I became the big, unactive, unsocial guy I am now. People think Im weird because I dont talk much but once you actually get to know me im still quite social, I have talants like apparently im good at dancing and drawing, im also good with listening and giving advice when needed. On my own time I simply hang out with my dog, watch tv, play games/vr, play with my guns or im sleep.</p>
