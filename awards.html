<h1> Accolades </h1>
<p1> I dont remember any real awards but I do remember some of the awards I earned at my old school at Walter G Byers. One of the awards I earned was the AB Honors award( I got A´s and B´s), Golden bulldog award(best behaved student), and the golden rule award( treat people the way u want to be treated). </p1>
