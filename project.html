  <h1> Programing Projects </h1>
  <p1> One of my programing projects were me making a website about nature and different leaves. It was a scince projects i did in the 5th grade but the programming part was way more simple.
    
    Another programming project I had was a code that had three different cars with different top speeds, the output of the code was supposed to tell you the different top speeds of the three cars.
    
    My last programming project was me comparing and contrasting four different data structures in a google slide presintation with a video. </p1>
